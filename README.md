## Quizzes 

> Choose from a variety of quizzes with an array of difficulties to test your skills


Each individual user will have 2 attempts at a quiz.  The maximum score on the first try will automatically close out the quiz for that user.

Based on the score the user will recieve a certain amount of crowns which will be permanetly added to their profile in their crown total.  The higher amount of crowns a user has the higher on the leaderboard they will be.

If on the first attempt the user recieves three crowns and on the second attempt the user recieves four crowns.  The total crown amount will be adjusted accordingly and increase by one.

The rest of the profile page will show the users total crown amounts, as well as, the Crown tier they are currently at.
